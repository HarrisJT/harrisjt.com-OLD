    <h1 class="article__title">The New Dawn of HarrisJT</h1>
    <h2 class="article__subtitle">In this article, I will discuss what this site is and how it was/is made. Strap on
        in&hellip;</h2>

    <h3>Where am I?</h3>
    <p>I wanted a website to house my professional portfolio and profile as well as any writing I do. I could make (and hope to) websites in all different layouts using any assortment of colors and fancy
        animations but committing to one design that shows creativity and usability were of primary importance to me. So
        here it is, a portfolio, resume, blog, playground extravaganza.
    </p>
    <p>I love to build on a platform that is usable to a hard-of-sight rural person with a 46” LCD <em>and</em> an urban
        toddler with a mobile phone on the complete opposite side of the planet. What other medium allows that?
    </p>
    <h3>What is harrisjt.com made from?</h3>

    <p>I hope you like vanilla flavoring because that’s all I got left. No external resources mean that no single
        character is meaningless here and that helps me sleep at night.
    </p>
    <p>Not that I dislike libraries, there is always a use case and need for a single dependency to handle security and
        edge cases. In fact, the throttle function that I use so that scrolling on the homepage doesn’t trigger 1
        million events is from the <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/throttle.js" target="_blank"
                                      rel="noopener">lodash utility library</a>.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="throttle-console.gif" alt="screenshot of no throttle console"/>
        <figcaption>Without a throttle, scrolling would trigger the function to change pages too many times.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I took the throttle code which is just a wrapper for the debounce function and combined the two removing
        unnecessary code along the way into a single function that works better than any other throttlers I could find.
    </p>
    <p>Two topics I learned from reading that I wasn’t using to even near the full capabilities were Google Analytics
        and
        Service Workers.
    </p>
    <p>I read a <a href="https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-google-analytics-setup-i-use-on-every-site-i-build/"
                   target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantastic
        article</a> by the
        fantastic Philip Walton about analytics that made me revisit my tracking data and decide to start from anew.
        This essentially gives you much more variables to play around with in tracking and allows you to load the script
        in quicker and ignore “junk” data. Service workers I had only played around with in experiments but in my
        current script on this page, I have near complete control of caching and the added benefit of offline support!
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/HarrisJT/harrisjt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete code for this
        website</a> is available to anyone with internet
        access. I have always made my portfolio public because this serves multiple purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This site is a public display of myself and making the source code fully accessible is an extension of that
        </li>
        <li>The idea that at any time someone can comb through my code keeps me fully alert</li>
        <li>I’m proud of where this site is at!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plus I <em>love</em> github so any practice I get using it is well received!</p>

    <h4>Planning</h4>

    <p>My planning style is surely not to be recast at any enterprise level but it certainly has improved over time. I
        use trello boards for all my planning which I began doing when I was a project manager for the
        <a href="https://FeelTheBern.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeelTheBern.org</a> volunteer group. I have
        long believed that writing down every idea that
        pops up will provide me a great well when I lack nourishment and have seen great benefits from doing so. Trello
        allows me to organize ideas relating to a specific project and track them from my queue to in progress all the
        way through to the release version.
    </p>

    <figure>
        <img src="trello.png" alt="my trello board"/>
        <figcaption>Full size image: <a href="trello-full.png" target="_blank">view here</a>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Most of the designing I do is in my head but when I need to organize something complicated or validate myself I
        draw it out on paper. When first launching into a project I will also do some preliminary half-boxey
        half-detailed photoshop versions so I can get a rough idea for colors and have something I end up referring to
        in order to make sure I haven't lost sight of the original goals. I realize this is where I need to make an
        improvement but
        a part of my style is due to my lack of experience or work on any larger projects that require the stuff in my
        head to be “commentable” on by others. I do like working this way but am not at all averse to extensive planning
        and have been proven wrong many times given user and team feedback. A mistake I will never make again.
    </p>
    <h4>Backend</h4>

    <p>I have always trusted DigitalOcean as my hosting service and since they had me hooked from when I still had
        student credit I am still running with them today. I like them because they forced me to learn the hard way to
        getting a web server running and securing it. For the purposes of this site, I only use a small Linux Ubuntu
        16.04 server.
        Namecheap is another resource that I had early student credit on but continued using due to their easy
        purchasing and setup system. I have never had a single problem with Namecheap and you will find them
        recommended, along with DigitalOcean, across the web.
    </p>
    <p>I use Nginx as my web server engine because they are small and fast with all the support you could ever want. I
        start all my web servers off with the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx" target="_blank"
                                                 rel="noopener">HTML5 Boilerplate server
            config</a> because it is open source and being constantly improved.
        From there I installed an auto-renewing LetsEncrypt certificate for https and http/2 support and ensured that my
        web server security met the latest standards.
    </p>
    <h3>What next?</h3>

    <p>I will continue changing this site for a long time and I imagine it will look a whole lot different year after
        year.
        Some of my plans include better animations for all my elements and logos, a better “experiments” page, and a
        blog searching/tagging system.
    </p>
    <p>You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Harrisjt_" target="_blank">Twitter</a> where I plan to tweet
        more regularly and keep an eye
        on the <a href="https://github.com/HarrisJT/harrisjt.com" target="_blank">GitHub project</a>.
